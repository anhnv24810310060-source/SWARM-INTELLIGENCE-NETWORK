# Security & Intelligence Layer Enhancements (Progress)

Date: 2025-10-02

## Components Added
- signature-engine: in-memory rule store with hot reload, KMP substring matcher (baseline) and metrics.
- anomaly-detection: FastAPI service stub with /v1/predict + /v1/explain, OTEL metrics.
- threat-intel: internal indicator store (lock-striped, TTL aware), scoring & correlator primitives.
- audit-trail: append-only Merkle chain log with verification and append endpoints.

## Metrics Exposed
- swarm_signatures_matched_total
- swarm_scan_duration_seconds
- swarm_ml_inference_latency_ms
- swarm_audit_events_total
- swarm_audit_verifications_total

## Optimization Roadmap
1. signature-engine: Transition naive per-rule scan to Aho-Corasick; evaluate hyperscan integration.
2. anomaly-detection: Implement IsolationForest pipeline (fit -> serialize -> load); add p95 latency metric.
3. threat-intel: Add external feed collectors (OTX, VirusTotal) with adaptive backoff + ETag caching.
4. audit-trail: Persist segments to disk (WAL + periodic snapshot) + Merkle root anchoring (optional) into consensus.

## Testing Strategy (Planned)
- Unit: rule reload logic, KMP correctness, store TTL purge, risk scoring.
- Integration: feed collector -> indicator store -> correlator -> threat output path.
- Performance: synthetic payload set 10k files; target < 250ms aggregate scan.

## Next Steps
- Add structured config files (YAML) for service tunables.
- Introduce persistence abstraction for audit + indicators (Badger / Pebble).
- Add tracing spans for scan + correlate phases.

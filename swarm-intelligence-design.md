- **Self-Replication**: Spawning new instances when needed
- **Adaptive Evolution**: Continuously improving defense mechanisms

### 1.2 Biological Inspiration
The system mimics natural immune systems and swarm behaviors:

**Immune System Analogy:**
- Nodes = White blood cells
- Threats = Pathogens
- Network = Immune system
- Learning = Immunological memory

**Swarm Intelligence Analogy:**
- Nodes = Individual insects
- Communication = Pheromone trails
- Coordination = Emergent behavior
- Optimization = Collective problem-solving
